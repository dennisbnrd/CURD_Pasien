# Sistem Reservasi CRUD Pasien Rumah Sakit
This system is a simple Python-based application used to manage patient data, reservations, and doctor schedules. It runs on a terminal/command-line interface (CLI) and uses list and dictionary-based data structures.

## Business Understanding
Managing patient records, doctor schedules, and medical appointments is critical for ensuring efficient operations in hospitals and clinics. Many small- to medium-sized healthcare providers still rely on manual systems, which are prone to human error, delays, and data inconsistency. This project aims to simulate a basic hospital information system using Python, designed to improve operational workflows by digitizing:
- Patient Data Management: Storing and updating patient personal information in a structured format, with input validation to maintain data integrity.
- Reservation System: Allowing patients to book, view, or cancel reservations based on available doctors and schedules, reducing miscommunication and overlapping appointments.
- Doctor Scheduling: Letting administrators easily manage doctor availability by day and specialization, making it easier to match patients with the right doctors.

This system is especially useful for:
- Demonstrating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) logic in a real-world context
- Training or prototyping before implementing a full-stack hospital information system
- Educational purposes to understand how health records and scheduling work together
By streamlining core hospital functions with this CLI system, healthcare facilities can reduce clerical workload, minimize errors, and deliver a more organized service to patients.
